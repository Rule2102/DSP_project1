In order to adapt the code & HIL simulation for active low logic the following has been changed:
- PWM_CMP_x = 1-d;
- error is calculated as Ifb - Iref
- DBCTL.bit.POLASEL changed to 1 (active low complementary)
- TZ forces EPWMs high
- inverter in HIL simulation is configured to be active low
- running procedure changed from the one in uputsvto.txt (changes are UPPERCASE):

	1. HIL
		- open bldc.tse in schematic editor
		- load model to scada
		- open bldc.cus
		- load bldc.runx
		- SET MOTOR SPEED TO ZERO
	2. CCS
		- build &run
		- reg_enabled = 1;
	3. HIL
		- SET MOTOR SPEED TO 565.4867 rad/s
	4. CCS
		- Iqref = 7:
		- canPrint = 1 to collect step response results (Idq)
		- export from memory browser
	5. MATLAB
		- import & plot results
