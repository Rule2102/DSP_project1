Ivan's modification of Vuksa's script for optimization

1.) Optimization init script: 
Define limits for optimization (in script I believe they are relative to Ts, 
because z with Ts = 1 is taken, I forgot).
bw_min - minimum required -3dB bandwidth
bw_target - what I want to achieve
weight_speed - not sure if I use this check in getperf.m
peak_target - peak of sensitivity TF (something to indicate robustness, overshoot related)

2.) searchnew.m - do not modify 

3.) VMall.m - do not modify

4.) getperf.m:
Here you need to define z=domain transfer function (as arrays of denominator and numerator),
based on a (alpha) and d.
There are several examples there already - you need to put the one for our case 
(MAF in feedback)
Later u use criteria to make some sort of optimization (weighting...)
I use limit that I must have bw > bw_min, settle time < 30 steps.
Then I optimize based on perf1: how lcose am I to bandwidth; perf2: how close am I to resoant peak

What you can do:
See for vuksa's gains what does he get regarding resonant peak and -3dB bandwidth.
Put same values in your optimization (but now bandwidth is relative to N = 8 do not forget this!)
Also, remember that vuksa uses transfer function, without calculational delay. So transfer functions
will be slightly different.
Place target bandwidth for example 10% higher than his, and see if you can achieve it
