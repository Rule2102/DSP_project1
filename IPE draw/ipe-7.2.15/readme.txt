                    Ipe extensible drawing editor
                    =============================

Introduction
============

This is the extensible drawing editor Ipe.  Ipe allows you to create
figures in PDF format, for inclusion into LaTeX (or plain TeX)
documents as well as stand-alone PDF documents, for instance to print
transparencies or for on-line presentations.

See the manual for an introduction. It is available in HTML format,
either in the "build/doc" subdirectory of the source distribution, or
by selecting Help -> Ipe manual from the Ipe user interface.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a binary distribution for Windows XP or higher (zoom and pan
gestures will only work on Windows 7 or higher).

The original sources used to compile this package can be found on the
Ipe homepage (see below).

You can unzip this binary distribution whereever you like.  You can
then find (and start) the Ipe executable in the "bin" subdirectory.

You will want to either add the "bin" subdirectory to your path, or
add a shortcut to Ipe to your desktop or your start menu.

Ipe uses Latex to create beautiful text.  Ipe can either use a
Latex-compilation service in the cloud (latexonline.cc), or a local
Latex installation on your computer. For Windows, I recommend both the
MikTeX distribution ("http://www.miktex.org") and Texlive for Windows
(http://tug.org/texlive/windows.html).  Make sure that 'pdflatex' is
on your path!

There are three icons in "data" that you can use for your Ipe files
(*.xml, *.eps, and *.ipe files) (thanks to Bettina Speckmann for
making these).

Ipe uses the Zlib library (www.gzip.org/zlib), the Freetype 2 library
(www.freetype.org), the Cairo library (www.cairographics.org), the
libspiro library (github.com/fontforge/libspiro), as well as some code
from Xpdf (www.foolabs.com/xpdf).  Ipe contains the Lua 5.3
interpreter (www.lua.org), and relies on Pdflatex for rendering text,
either locally on your computer or in a cloud service.

Before reporting a bug, check that you have the latest version, and
check that it is not yet mentioned in the FAQ on the Ipe webpage.

You can report bugs on the bug tracking system at
"http://ipe.otfried.org/bugzilla.html".  Check the existing
reports to see whether your bug has already been reported.  Please do
not send bug reports directly to me (the first thing I would do with
the report is to enter it into the bug tracking system).

Suggestions for features, or random comments on Ipe can be sent to the
Ipe discussion mailing list at <ipe-discuss@lists.science.uu.nl>.  If
you have problems installing or using Ipe and cannot find a guru among
your real-life friends, the Ipe discussion mailing list would also be
the best place to ask.

You can send suggestions or comments directly to me by Email, but you
should then not expect a reply.  I cannot dedicate much time to Ipe,
and the little time I have I prefer to put into development.  I'm much
more likely to get involved in a discussion of desirable features on
the mailing list, where anyone interested can participate, rather than
by direct Email.

If you write interesting ipelets that might be useful to others,
please put a link or copy (as you prefer) on the Ipe wiki.  Feel free
to advertise them on the Ipe discussion list!
